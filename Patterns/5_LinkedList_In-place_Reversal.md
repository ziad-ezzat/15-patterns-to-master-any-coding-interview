# LinkedList In-place Reversal
In-place Reversal of a LinkedList pattern reverses parts of a linked list without using extra space.

Use this pattern when you need to reverse sections of a linked list.

## Sample Problem
Reverse a sublist of a linked list from position m to n.

Example:

Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], m = 2, n = 4
Output: [1, 4, 3, 2, 5]
Explanation:

Identify the start and end of the sublist.
Reverse the nodes in place by adjusting the pointers.
