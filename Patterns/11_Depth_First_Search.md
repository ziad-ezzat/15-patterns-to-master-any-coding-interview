# Depth First Search (DFS)
Depth-First Search (DFS) is a traversal technique that explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.

Use this pattern for exploring all paths or branches in graphs or trees.

## Sample Problem
Find all paths from the root to leaves in a binary tree.

Example:

Input: root = [1, 2, 3, null, 5]
Output: ["1->2->5", "1->3"]
Explanation:

Use recursion or a stack to traverse each path from the root to the leaves.
Record each path as you traverse.
